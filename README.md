# Corber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/corber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/corber)

Corber is a CLI that improves the hybrid app build experience for Vue, Ember, Glimmer, and React apps using Cordova.

Corber handles framework and app builds and validations with a single command: `corber build` - without affecting existing web flows. The CLI also includes on-device livereload for development and utility functions for plugins, and more. And when needed, it can proxy to the Cordova CLI.

It is a continuation of the ember-cordova project. ember-cordova users can find details [here](http://blog.isleofcode.com/announcing-corber-ember-cordova-vue), and continue to access the existing [ember addon](https://github.com/isleofcode/ember-cordova) and [documentation](http://ember-cordova.com). For migration instructions, see [Migrating from Ember Cordova](http://corber.io/pages/ember-cordova-migration).

## Installation

```
# Yarn
yarn global add corber

# NPM
npm install -g corber
```

## Initialize Corber
1. Change to your project directory.
2. Run `corber init`.
3. Select iOS and press space to select the platform.

## Configure Your Project for Corber
### Vue CLI 3
1. Open `vue.config.js`. (Create file in project root if it doesn't exist. See [Example Vue Config](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/vue).)
2. Require `corber-webpack-plugin` and assign it as `CorberWebpackPlugin`.
3. Add `new CorberWebpackPlugin()` to the `configureWebpack.plugins` array.

For Vue CLI 2 or Non-Vue CLI, see [Configure Vue CLI 2 or Non-Vue CLI projects](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/vue).

### Ember
1. Open `config/environment.js`.
2. Set `locationType` to `hash`.
3. Update `rootURL` or `baseURL` to remove its leading slash, if it has one.

### Extending Frameworks
Corber comes with built-in support for Vue, Ember, and React, but can be extended to work with the framework of your choice. See [Extending Corber to Support Other Frameworks](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/extending).
